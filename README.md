# ChronicGPT
An Ollama HTML JS client

Download index.html and extract to a folder example c:\chronicgpt

Open a command window and go to the folder with cd c:\chronicgpt

Use Python3 as an HTTP server to load the index.html in that folder with:

python3 -m http.server

Then go to http://localhost:8000 and your set.

Obviously you need Ollama for Windows installed and running on the default port.
